An app where you can track 3 daily happy memories
  On the home page there's a form. You enter 3 memories, and save them
  <Welcome#homepage renders the form>
  <Check if they're logged in before submitting the form>
    The Form has a text input that collects the memory up to 500 characters
      <form_tag that has 3 input_tags, and a submit_tag>
      name="person" # => {person: "whatever"}
      name="person[name]" # => {person: {name: "whatever"}}
      name="person[hobbies][]" #=> {person: {hobbies: ["whatever"]}}
      name="person[hobbies][]" #=> {person: {hobbies: ["whatever","next thing"]}}
      name="person[hobbies][]" #=> {person: {hobbies: ["whatever","next thing", "last"]}}
      When you press 'save', it sends the memories to the app (Controller#action), then
      sends you to a summary of memories for that day
      <Memory Model, saving 3 of them. Have to use form_tag to collect the memories>
      <In Memories#create params[:memories].each ... Create a memory>

      <Associate the memory to the logged in user
